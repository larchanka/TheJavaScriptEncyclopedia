The JavaScript Encyclopedia

This is an extremely incomplete encyclopedic presentation of the
JavaScript programming language as hypertext.

These files are a prototype in HTML:

encyclopedia.css    The encyclopedic style
index.html          The Table of Contents
A.html              The A articles
...                 ...
Z.html              The Z articles
special             The articles about special characters
preface.html        The story of the project
introduction.html   How the encyclopedia works
overview.html       An overview of the language
regexp.html         The appendix on regular expressions
browser.html        The appendix on web browsers
css.html            The appendix on Cascading Style Sheets

The JavaScript Encyclopdia prototype may be viewed at
http://www.crockford.com/javascript/encyclopedia.

The goal of this project is to produce a complete encyclopedia for the current
language and any future versions that might appear. The encyclopedia will be
developed in Cyc, a simple language that was inspired by Brian Reid's Scribe.
Cyc is described in the prototype preface.

cyc.js              A simple Cyc processor
onehtml.js          Rules for outputing a single HTML file
include.js          A simple @include preprocessor

Since ES3 is obsolete and should be extinct by the time this processor is 
finished, ES3 notices will be dropped in favor of ES5 notices.
